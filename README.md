# Dengue Report Analysis Dashboard | Excel, PivotTables

This project presents a two-page Excel dashboard for analyzing dengue outbreak data, offering deep insights into patient demographics, diagnostic results, and geographic spread. The dashboard is intended for public health officials and researchers to support targeted interventions and disease control strategies.
🎯 Objective

    To visualize dengue case data for rapid analysis of infection patterns, high-risk areas, and demographic trends, enabling more effective outbreak response.

Page 2 – Diagnostic Insights & Recommendations

    Diagnostic Summary Table:

        Test combination patterns with their clinical meanings

    Insights:

        NS1 identified as the most reliable test with 57% positivity rate

        Adult (31–50) and Young Adult (19–30) groups most affected

        Higher infection rates in undeveloped areas and certain high-risk zones

    Recommendations:

        Prioritize NS1 testing for early detection

        Target awareness campaigns for high-risk age groups

        Strengthen vector control in undeveloped zones

        Conduct indoor prevention drives in high-risk house types

        Focus surveillance on top-risk zones like Jatrabari and Demra

💡 Insights Gained

    NS1 testing is critical for early detection due to high accuracy.

    Most cases are concentrated in adults and young adults.

    Buildings and tin sheds show higher indoor transmission risk.

    Geographic clustering indicates targeted local interventions can be more effective.
